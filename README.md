👋 Hi, I'm @Dev-next-gen!

🧠 IA Architect | 🛡️ Cybersecurity Specialist | ⚙️ Systems Optimizer | 🔗 Blockchain Builder

    “Self-taught, system-level thinker with hands-on expertise in low-level optimization, AI integration, GPU-level parallelism and secure blockchain automation.”

🧬 Who I Am
I'm a self-taught developer & hacker of systems, specialized in multi-GPU optimization (OpenCL/ROCm), advanced AI integration, and cybersecurity engineering.
I build tools from the ground up — kernel to UI — and I optimize everything in between.

💼 What I Do Best

    AI Runtime Optimization:
    Custom builds (e.g., KoboldCpp) with OpenCL multi-GPU support on AMD hardware, optimized for inference on high-RAM Xeon-based rigs (512GB+).

    Cybersecurity Engineering:
    Offensive & defensive scripting, honeypot deployment, SOC monitoring automation, and root-level system defense with AI-enhanced response systems.

    Blockchain & DeFi:
    Secure smart contract development (Solidity/Rust), vulnerability research (reentrancy, MEV exploits), and DeFi automation bots.

    Backends That Run Fast & Hard:
    Production-grade APIs using Rust (Rocket) and Python (FastAPI) for performance-critical systems.

    Autonomous Systems (DeepSeek R1):
    Self-improving Linux-based AI agent with dynamic storage, resource balancing, and live kernel awareness.
    → Yes, an AI that can rebuild herself 🤖🔥
